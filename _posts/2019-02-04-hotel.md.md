## Now Multiple Authors Can Create Articles:

You can now create or collaborate with multiple authors,Especially when you are working with teams. Each author will have a unique page of her written articles also her profile widget in Articles written by his/her.

For this every Author needs to have a unique username (without space) For eg. If Author is John Doe - the username should be **johndoe** or **john-doe** (without space).This key will be used by devlopr, to fetch individual author's profile pages internally.
